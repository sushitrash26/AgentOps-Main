These rooms give you the full package with thrills, fun, intelligence and scares. We did 3 rooms which included “Cabin in the woods”, “Silent Legacy” and “A night in Bhangrah”. Cabin in the woods was a room which seemed small but it was enormous when you went ahead. I definitely recommend taking 3 people minimum for maximum efficiency. This room was perfect for beginners with all necessary thrills. The clues given were helpful and the staff was always helpful. For Silent legacy however it challenged our minds making us escape the room a bit slower than the others. It seemed like a small room but let me assure you there are surprises! The room challenges with your mind and chills you with the matching music. Lastly a Night in Bangarh was the most fun and unexpected room that I had done. The different elements with sensor based thrills will surely get a shrill to your senses. To conclude I would highly recommend coming to these mystery rooms to energize your thinking and have a day which is fun and investing in all types of ways. The staff are kind and welcoming in rooms and in the general assembly.

Me and my husband took the Shantaram Tour in Mumbai in October 2024, and we couldn't be happier with the experience. Our guide Kumar was exceptionally knowledgeable, friendly, and accommodating. He shared fascinating stories and insights at every stop, making the novel \"Shantaram\" (my best-ever read book, based on a true story) come to life right before our eyes. An exciting detail is that Kumar is actually the nephew of the real Prabaker, who was Shantaram's guide in the book, adding an extra layer of authenticity to the experience. We visited some iconic locations mentioned in the book, such as Sagar Wada Slum, Leopold's Café, Sassoon Dock, and many others. Kumar's storytelling ability truly captivated us, and we left with a deeper appreciation for the city and its people. We highly recommend this tour to anyone looking to explore Mumbai through the lens of \"Shantaram.\" It was an unforgettable experience, and Kumar was a fantastic guide who added immense value to our journey. Thank you, Kumar, for making our visit to Mumbai so memorable!

We went on a Ferry to Mandwa and then a bus to Alibag beach and market. We got to eat Vada Pav, go to the Lotus lake and see women washing their family's clothes, see brick making, go to a local school, have lunch with a village family in their home, visit the tribal village and then see the piranha lake! It was an incredible day and I'm so thankful to have had this opportunity. Our guide, Javed, was amazing, friendly and super informative. Thank you for the wonderful work you do at Reality Tours.

Debjani GuhaBose Kolkata (Calcutta), India 5 contributions 0 5.0 of 5 bubbles Tigress, Oranges and Tathastu - life time experience given by Nature Explorers India My son and myself went for a trip to Satpura forest, MP. It was fabulous. First of all, Nature Explorers India should be sole choice, if one plans a jungle trip in India. They pamper you to the hilt. Right from transport from the city to the jungle, accommodation, safari trips, Nature Explorers does it all with super professionalism. Their staffs are extremely meticulous with an eye for detail. They will observe your interests and shall cater to all of those if not more. Like we got a young guitarist singing for us and we had great fun !! Stay: Tathastu is another name for relaxation and care for me now. The food, staff, hospitality everything was awesome. It does feel special when even the morning gardener smiles in the morning and greets you ! Must say extremely well trained staff, be it chef, restaurant serving people or reception and room service. I would give them 10/10. Guide: Sujeet is an asset at Satpura no qualms on that ! He knows the jungle like that palm of his hand as well as the animals therein. It was because of his 'hunch' that we could see the tigress marking her territory and walking. Additionally, he gave us valuable insights on the trees and history of Satpura. Very well behaved, jovial and quite knowledgeable, Sujeet did give us an unforgettable trip. Naturalist: A sumptuous dinner is incomplete without a proper dessert. I would say Mr. Yogesh served to be the dessert of our Satpura experience. His varied range of jungle experience, all smiling face really touched us. Our topics ranged from jungles to tigers to politics to ecology and what not. It was indeed very intriguing. Finally a big shout out to Saurabh, Pratham and their team. I would also thank Vrunda (customer relationship manager) for taking very very good care of us. Also the car drivers to and fro Nagpur to Satpura and back. Both were very well behaved and even helped us buy oranges at cheap prices from the orchards we passed by. THANK YOU !!!!

Sharon_Francesca Mumbai, India 8 contributions 0 5.0 of 5 bubbles Rewarding visit to Iceland - truly the land of fire and ice! Well organized tour plan to South Iceland, with adequate nights in hotels in areas of minimal light pollution to view the Northern Lights. The tour plan also covered day visits to historical sites, the geysers, lava caves, volcanic zones, glacial lagoons, etc. Reasonably priced eating and shopping places were also included in the plan. Last day visit to the Blue Lagoon was a much needed respite from the last 2 cold winter days.

This has been my 2nd excursion with this group and first for marine walk. The experience has been exhilarating sighting so many marine species with help of Sachin. His zeal to search for species is never ending. Thank you for organizing and conducting this tour. I loved to see all the species but sighting four different species of sea slugs was just great. I wish Sachin and the team all the best in all their future endeavours.

I visited Mumbai earlier this week with some co-workers and I had a day to tour around before our business meetings and I had to move on to Italy. Viren took us around the slums and gave us an eye-opening tour of the real Mumbai. He's a talker so he shared a TON of information about the area while he walked us around and facilitated connections with locals. He casually mentioned getting tailored shirts in Mumbai and I actually need some work shirts so I asked him if he could facilitate. He generously took me to an amazing tailor, waited while I picked out shirts and fabrics, and then brought me back. Super appreciative for his generosity and would happily recommend him to anyone looking for the inside scoop of Mumbai!

Marius S 2 contributions 0 5.0 of 5 bubbles Great Trip organized for us on short notice Varun planned our trip as we had a limited amount of time and really wanted to see some of the national parks in Kerala. He was very communicative and took into account our wants and wishes, and also recommended bird-watching, as it was the best season for it. We first visited Thattekad, then Periyar in 3 days total. He booked a very helpful and friendly driver for us, Amal. Who accompanied us for the whole trip. In Thattekad we had a personal guide who was excellent for showing us many rare and endemic bird species. Our hotel there, Nadiyoram was beautiful, the best hotel we had in India during our trip. Great food and a lake-like river right in front of our room, which was clean enough to swim in. Afterwards Periyar was beautiful as well, though a little more touristy. We enjoyed nonetheless and were able to see a lot of endemic wildlife like nilgiri langurs, the south indian birdwing, and also wild elephants and many different bird species. Also we went to a Kalaripayattu presentation in Thekkady, recommended by Varun which was awesome.
